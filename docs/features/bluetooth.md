# Bluetooth support

The Kobo plugin provides Bluetooth management for MTK-based Kobo devices. You can enable/disable
Bluetooth, scan for nearby devices, pair and connect to devices, and manage paired devices from
KOReader.

## Supported devices

- Kobo Libra Colour
- Kobo Clara BW / Colour
- Kobo Elipsa 2E

## How to use

- Open main menu and choose Settings → Network → Bluetooth.
- Use "Enable/Disable" to toggle Bluetooth.
- Open "Paired devices" to see devices you have previously paired (including devices paired via Kobo
  Nickel). From the paired devices list you can:
  - Connect or disconnect a device
  - Open the key binding configuration (when connected) to map device events to actions
  - Forget a device to unpair it and remove it from the list

**Note:** Paired devices can only be connected when they are nearby and discoverable. Use "Scan for
devices" to detect nearby devices (including paired devices that are currently discoverable). If a
paired device appears in the scan results, you can connect to it from the Paired devices list or
directly from the scan results.

## Configuring key bindings

When you connect a Bluetooth device that supports button input (such as a remote or keyboard), you
can map its buttons to KOReader actions.

To configure key bindings for a device:

1. Go to Paired devices and select the device you want to configure.
2. Choose "Configure key bindings" from the device menu - a list of available actions will appear.
3. Select an action you want to bind to a button.
4. Choose "Register button" - the system will now listen for the next button press on your device.
5. Press a button on your Bluetooth device - the system will capture and bind it to the selected
   action.
6. Repeat from step 3 for other actions you want to configure.

The available actions are defined in
[`src/lib/bluetooth/available_actions.lua`](https://github.com/OGKevin/kobo.koplugin/blob/main/src/lib/bluetooth/available_actions.lua).
If an action you need is missing, you can contribute by adding it to this file following the same
pattern as existing actions. See the plugin development documentation for details.

For more details, see [key-bindings](../settings/bluetooth-settings/key-bindings.md).

## Dispatcher integration

The plugin registers Bluetooth actions with KOReader's dispatcher system at startup, allowing you to
control Bluetooth using gestures, profiles, or other dispatcher-aware features.

### Bluetooth Control Actions

The following control actions are registered automatically:

- **Enable Bluetooth** — Turns Bluetooth on
- **Disable Bluetooth** — Turns Bluetooth off
- **Toggle Bluetooth** — Toggles Bluetooth on/off based on current state
- **Scan for Bluetooth Devices** — Starts a device scan and shows results

### Device Connection Actions

The plugin also registers actions for each paired Bluetooth device, allowing you to connect to
specific devices directly via dispatcher actions.

All Bluetooth actions can be found in the dispatcher system under the "Device" category.

## Notes and tips

- Bluetooth is only supported on Kobo devices with MediaTek (MTK) hardware. If your device does not
  support Bluetooth, the menu will not be shown.
- When Bluetooth is enabled, KOReader prevents the device from entering standby until you disable
  Bluetooth.
- The device will still automatically suspend or shutdown according to your power settings when
  Bluetooth is enabled.
- Paired devices are remembered in the plugin settings so you can reconnect even if Bluetooth is off
  at startup.
