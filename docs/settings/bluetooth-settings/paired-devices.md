# Paired Devices

The plugin maintains a list of all Bluetooth devices that have been paired with your Kobo, including
devices paired through Kobo Nickel.

## Viewing Paired Devices

1. Navigate to Settings → Network → Bluetooth → Paired devices You'll see a list of all devices that
   have been paired with your Kobo.

## Connecting to a Device

1. Navigate to Settings → Network → Bluetooth → Paired devices
2. Select the device you want to connect
3. Choose "Connect"

Once connected, the device will be ready to use with KOReader.

## Disconnecting from a Device

1. Navigate to Settings → Network → Bluetooth → Paired devices
2. Select the connected device
3. Choose "Disconnect"

The device remains paired but will no longer be actively connected.

## Forgetting a Paired Device

1. Navigate to Settings → Network → Bluetooth → Paired devices
2. Select the device you want to forget
3. Choose "Forget"

This unpairs the device from your Kobo and removes it from the paired devices list. You'll need to
pair it again to use it.

## Pairing a New Device

1. Put your Bluetooth device in pairing mode (refer to your device's manual)
2. Navigate to Settings → Network → Bluetooth
3. Choose "Scan for devices"
4. Select your device from the list
5. Follow any on-screen prompts to complete pairing

## Notes

- Devices paired in Kobo Nickel automatically appear in KOReader's paired devices list
- You can reconnect to any paired device without needing to pair it again
- Paired devices can only be connected when they are nearby and discoverable. Use "Scan for devices"
  (Settings → Network → Bluetooth → Scan for devices) to detect nearby devices. This includes new
  devices to pair as well as previously paired devices that have become discoverable. If a paired
  device appears in the scan results you can connect to it from the Paired devices list without
  having to trigger a scan. So remember how to put the device in discoverable mode.
